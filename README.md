# Personal Data Science Skill Development Repository

Welcome to my Personal Data Science Skill Development Repository! This repository is my personal space for learning and enhancing my skills in the field of Data Science. It's where I'll be keeping track of my projects, resources, and progress as I work towards becoming a proficient Data Scientist.


# Projects

I'll be working on a variety of Data Science projects to build hands-on experience and apply theoretical concepts. These projects might include:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on various datasets
- Building machine learning models for different tasks
- NLP experiments and sentiment analysis
- Creating data visualizations and interactive dashboards
- Time series analysis and forecasting

# Goals

My primary goal is self-improvement and acquiring practical Data Science skills. I plan to regularly update this repository with new projects and document my progress. By keeping track of my journey here, I can look back and see how far I've come in my learning journey.

# Contact

While this repository is mainly for personal use, I'm always open to connecting with fellow learners and enthusiasts. If you'd like to reach out, share insights, or just chat about Data Science, feel free to contact me via email at pedrosergey.datascience@gmail.com.
